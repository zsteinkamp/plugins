  description: |
    Gives precise real-time control of note length. Crisco Note Shortening trades latency for convenience in being able to micro-tune note lengths, e.g. if you have notes in your piano roll that are legato but you want to shorten them to avoid the note release from interacting with the following note. Suggested by *Marlon* who makes Psytrance, where precise control like this is important.

  repo: https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-FractalNoteEcho
  description: |
    This is a MIDI Effect device that will trigger notes in a fractal pattern. The base fractal shape (in terms of timing between echo taps) can be defined, then number of iterations and iteration scale can be controlled. The kinds of textures you can get out of it are really surprising, and have been inspiring to me. There is a natural beauty and harmony to fractals, which can contribute a more natural feel to your sounds.

    This device is mostly implemented in Javascript in Max For Live. Super fun to make.

  repo: https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-zs-Faderboard3
  description: |
    This device was inspired by the Vestax Faderboard. It is an odd kind of sampler, with 10 voices to play back a sample at your chosen pitch. The thing that makes it unique is that each voice is played using a dedicated fader, and the sample is triggered when the fader leaves the silent position.

    You can also control voice left/right pan position, loop start and end (with the ability to go backwards!), and trigger all voices to restart playing. The device outputs a stereo mix, but all 10 stereo channels are available independently too.

  description: |
    This is a MIDI Effect device that will repeat notes, with each repeat delay following the Fibonacci Sequence. You can control the number of repeats, time scale, pitch, and velocity change.
